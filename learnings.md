## Actionable Signals
<!-- Feedback that should be encoded into a specific file. Clear after encoding. -->

## Pattern-Building Data
<!-- Observations accumulating toward the 3+ threshold. Clear after promotion. -->


## Direct Statements
<!-- Explicit preferences. Encode immediately, then clear. -->

## Signal History
<!-- Optional audit trail. Brief one-liners noting what was promoted/cleared and when. -->

- **2026-02-22** — KPI design principle promoted (direct statement): KPI cards must answer "where should I spend my reading time?" → project CLAUDE.md > Promoted Rules. Cleared from buffer.
- **2026-02-22** — Verification scope promoted (immediate, user directive): DOD Verification gate now requires Playwright checks on **every affected page**, not just the primary view → project CLAUDE.md > DOD Checklist.
- **2026-02-22** — DOD enforcement gap promoted: added DOD Checklist + Plan-Mode Requirement sections to project CLAUDE.md, plus promoted rule. Root cause: prior session skipped 3/3 DOD gates (DB, architecture diagram, Playwright).

- **2026-02-20** — Enforcement gap encoded: broadened "structural change" definition in Documentation Update Rule → project CLAUDE.md
- **2026-02-16** — Direct statement encoded: post-fix debrief rule → global CLAUDE.md > Interaction Style
- **2026-02-16** — Workflow correction encoded: check skill prerequisites before running protocols → global CLAUDE.md > Promoted Rules
- **2026-02-16** — Workflow correction encoded: only report skills actually triggered in session-end reports → global CLAUDE.md > Promoted Rules
