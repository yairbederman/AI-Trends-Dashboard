## Actionable Signals
<!-- Feedback that should be encoded into a specific file. Clear after encoding. -->

## Pattern-Building Data
<!-- Observations accumulating toward the 3+ threshold. Clear after promotion. -->

## Direct Statements
<!-- Explicit preferences. Encode immediately, then clear. -->

## Signal History
<!-- Optional audit trail. Brief one-liners noting what was promoted/cleared and when. -->
